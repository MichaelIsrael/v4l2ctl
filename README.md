# v4l2ctl
v4l2ctl is a python package to control v4l2 drivers.

# Status
The project is still in its early development stages. It can, however, already
be used to read the name, driver, version and capabilities of a v4l2 device
driver, and read the supported frame sizes and intervals..

# Installation
```
pip install v4l2ctl
```

# Documentation
All documentation can be found [here](https://v4l2ctl.readthedocs.io/).

# Testing
There is a lot to be tested and unfortunately, I don't have enough camera
devices to test all features. If you find any bugs or problems, please don't
hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/MichaelIsrael/v4l2ctl/issues).
